# BaSIS-Net
Basis-Net: From Point Estimate to Predictive Distribution in Neural Networks - A Bayesian Sequential Importance Sampling Framework

This repository contains the implementation of BaSIS-Net as described in the paper. 
The project is structured into three main Python scripts:

- **Main.py**: The main script to run training and testing.
- **model_functions.py**: Contains functions related to the model, such as generating particles, computing importance ratios, and likelihood.
- **other_functions.py**: Contains other utility functions, such as generating plots (e.g., histograms with predictive distributions).

## Requirements

Scripts
Main.py
This is the main script to run the training and testing of BaSIS-Net. It uses arguments to control its behavior.

model_functions.py
This script includes all functions related to the model, such as generating particles and computing importance ratios and likelihood.

other_functions.py
This script includes various utility functions, such as generating histograms with predictive distributions.
