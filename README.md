# BaSIS-Net
Basis-Net: From Point Estimate to Predictive Distribution in Neural Networks - A Bayesian Sequential Importance Sampling Framework

This repository contains the implementation of BaSIS-Net as described in the paper. 
The project is structured into two folders (one for MNIST and one for CIFAR-10):

## Scripts

- **Main_MNIST.py**: The main script to run training and testing for the MNIST dataset.
- **Main_CIFAR.py**: The main script to run training and testing for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **model_functions.py**: Contains functions related to the model, such as generating particles, computing importance ratios, and likelihood.
- **other_functions.py**: Contains other utility functions, such as generating plots (e.g., histograms with predictive distributions) and computing metrics.

## Requirements
